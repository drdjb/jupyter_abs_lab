    "\n",
    "+ There must be two types of agents; attackers and attacked.\n",
    "+ Each attacker must have a random level between 1 to 10 as their attribute.\n",
    "+ Each victim/attacked must have either high (20% chance), medium (50% chance), or low (80%) chance as their attribute (Think of this as their chance of survival, or their security level).\n",
    "+ Each victim can also have one of the three states = not attacked, attacked, and compromised.\n",
    "+ The way the attacks work is the attacker must have a sufficient level equivalent to the chance range of the victim/attacked. \n",
    "+ Level > 1 = sufficient for low chance, Level > 5 = sufficient for medium chance, Level > 9 = sufficient for high chance.\n",
    "+ e.g: If the attacker is level 7, it can attack medium and low, but not high chance victims. When that same attacker with level 7 attacks a medium victim, the medium victim has the status of \"attacked\", and the attacker has a 50% chance of being successful in their attack, which if they are, then the victim's status changes to \"compromised\".\n",
