    "+ Each victim/attacked must have either high (20% chance), medium (50% chance), or low (80%) chance as their attribute (Think of this as their chance of survival, or their security level).\n",
    "+ Each victim can also have one of the three states = not attacked, attacked, and compromised.\n",
